### Project Overview

 Perform ensembling using the models Decision Tree Classifier and Logistic Regression, using a VotingClassifier keeping the parameter voting as soft and the calculate the accuracy.


### Learnings from the project

 Based on the best gradient boosting classifier we can found  model with best parameters


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 
Plotted the training and testing error vs. number of trees


### Challenges faced

 Faced challenges during finding out models and parametrs selection
Also faced issues while encoding categorical features


### Additional pointers

 NA
